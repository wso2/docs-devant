Hover, from the perspective of API consumers, these changes should ideally not disrupt their API clients. Typically, API consumers are most concerned with major API version alterations, but there might be instances where minor version changes are communicated to them.</p> <p>Therefore, in the context of deployment tracks, API developers only need to specify the major and minor versions being delivered from a particular deployment track.
