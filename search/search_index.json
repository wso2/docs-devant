For step-by-step instructions on constructing a certificate chain with a root certificate, click here    To construct a certificate chain with a root certificate, you must organize and combine the certificates in the correct sequence. A typical certificate chain consists of the following:<ul> <li>Root certificate: The trusted self-signed certificate issued by the certificate authority (CA).</li> <li>Intermediate certificates (if any): Certificates issued by the root CA to subordinate CAs.</li> <li>Leaf certificate: Your end-entity certificate issued by the CA. This is an optional certificate that may be included within the chain or provided separately. Follow these steps to construct the certificate chain:<ol> <li>Obtain and organize your certificates in the correct order:<ul> <li>Leaf certificate: The public certificate issued by the CA. This is optional and may be included within the chain or provided separately.</li> <li>Intermediate certificates: Obtain these from the CA, if applicable.</li> <li>Root certificate: Obtain this from the CA.  If it is self-signed, it serves as the trust anchor.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Combine the certificates into a single file in the following order:<ul> <li>Leaf certificate: This is your public certificate issued by the CA.</li> <li>Intermediate certificates if applicable: Include these in the correct hierarchical order.</li> <li>Root certificate: Include this at the end of the file. Use a text editor or a command-line tool to concatenate the certificates into one file, ensuring each certificate begins and ends with the proper markers. Also make sure the <code>BEGIN CERTIFICATE</code> and <code>END CERTIFICATE</code> markers appear on a new line: <pre><code> -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n &lt;Leaf Certificate Content&gt;\n -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n &lt;Intermediate Certificate Content&gt;\n -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n &lt;Root Certificate Content&gt;\n -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n</code></pre></li> </ul> </li> <li>Save the concatenated file. You can save it with a name such as <code>certificate_chain.pem</code>.</li> <li>Use the following command to verify that your certificate chain is constructed correctly: <pre><code>openssl verify -CAfile &lt;root_or_bundle_cert&gt;.pem certificate_chain.pem\n</code></pre> Replace <code>&lt;root_or_bundle_cert&gt;.pem</code> with the path to your root certificate or a bundle containing both the root and intermediate certificates.</li> <li>Once the certificate chain is verified, upload it via the Devant Console:     <ul> <li>If the constructed chain includes the leaf certificate, follow these steps:<ul> <li>Upload the constructed certificate chain in the TLS Certificate field.</li> <li>Upload the private key file in the TLS Key File field.</li> <li>Do not upload a certificate chain file, as it is already included in the TLS certificate.</li> </ul> </li> <li>If the constructed chain does not include the leaf certificate, follow these steps:<ul> <li>Upload the leaf certificate in the TLS Certificate field.</li> <li>Upload the private key file in the TLS Key File field.</li> <li>Upload the constructed certificate chain in the Certificate Chain File field.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ol> </li> </ul> <p>To proceed with this step in this guide, click Let's Encrypt.</p> <li> <p>To save the custom domain, click Add.</p> </li> <p>Now, you have successfully added a custom domain for your organization.</p> <p>You can see the added custom domain listed in the Active Domains tab under the URL Settings tab.</p> <p></p> <p>The custom domain you added will be available to the entity types in the specified environment.

This feature is useful when you need certain user groups to have access to particular projects or for a set of projects.</p> <p>Devant uses Roles, Groups, and a Mapping level to control access to the Devant Console as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Role: A role is a collection of permissions. Devant has a predefined set of roles with permissions assigned to them. Learn more</li> <li> <p>Group: A group is a collection of users. A user group requires a role or multiple roles to be assigned to it so that the users in those groups get the relevant permissions via the assigned roles.

Devant has two defined resource levels.</p> <ul> <li>Organization: You can assign a role to a group or associate a group with a role within the organization. This ensures that all users in a group inherit the permissions granted by that role across all organizational resources. For example, if a user has <code>edit_project</code> permission at the organization mapping level, that user can edit all the projects in the organization.</li> <li>Project: You can assign a role to a group or associate a group with a role within a specific project resource.

For example, if a user has <code>edit_project</code> permission at the project mapping level, that user can only edit the specified project.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>In Devant, authorization operates by assigning a role to a group at a specified level.

Such assignments can grant users unintended permission to some projects, allowing them to perform tasks they shouldn't have access to.

For step-by-step instructions on constructing a certificate chain with a root certificate, click here    To construct a certificate chain with a root certificate, you must organize and combine the certificates in the correct sequence. A typical certificate chain consists of the following:<ul> <li>Root certificate: The trusted self-signed certificate issued by the certificate authority (CA).</li> <li>Intermediate certificates (if any): Certificates issued by the root CA to subordinate CAs.</li> <li>Leaf certificate: Your end-entity certificate issued by the CA. This is an optional certificate that may be included within the chain or provided separately. Follow these steps to construct the certificate chain:<ol> <li>Obtain and organize your certificates in the correct order:<ul> <li>Leaf certificate: The public certificate issued by the CA. This is optional and may be included within the chain or provided separately.</li> <li>Intermediate certificates: Obtain these from the CA, if applicable.</li> <li>Root certificate: Obtain this from the CA.  If it is self-signed, it serves as the trust anchor.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Combine the certificates into a single file in the following order:<ul> <li>Leaf certificate: This is your public certificate issued by the CA.</li> <li>Intermediate certificates if applicable: Include these in the correct hierarchical order.</li> <li>Root certificate: Include this at the end of the file. Use a text editor or a command-line tool to concatenate the certificates into one file, ensuring each certificate begins and ends with the proper markers. Also make sure the <code>BEGIN CERTIFICATE</code> and <code>END CERTIFICATE</code> markers appear on a new line: <pre><code> -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n &lt;Leaf Certificate Content&gt;\n -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n &lt;Intermediate Certificate Content&gt;\n -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n &lt;Root Certificate Content&gt;\n -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n</code></pre></li> </ul> </li> <li>Save the concatenated file.

For example, an authentication error category may result in different status codes like 401 or 403, depending on the specific issue. These errors may not reach the target and are sent to the client by the gateway. Conversely, a request might pass through the gateway but be rejected by the target (e.g., a 403 due to a payload validation issue at the backend).
