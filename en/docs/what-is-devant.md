# What is Devant?

Devant allows you to manage your own AI integration agents. Integrate any AI agent into the integrations you build in low-code and pro-code, and jump from siloed systems to intelligent digital experiences with Devant by WSO2—the AI iPaaS that your AI Agents can call “home”.

## Key capabilities of Devant

### Design for security, governance, and efficiency
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Organize enterprise systems into domains, exposing managed APIs, events, and data through projects. Each project consists of components representing units of deployment.
- **Application Security Design**: Leverage [cell-based architecture](https://github.com/wso2/reference-architecture/blob/master/reference-architecture-cell-based.md), where projects become governable units from development to deployment, ensuring managed access via APIs, events, and data.

### Efficient and effective development
- **Code in Any Language**: Develop applications in your team's preferred programming language, harnessing existing skill sets to build powerful polyglot APIs, services, events, tasks, and more.
- **Native Support for VS Code**: Seamlessly collaborate and manage code using VS Code in a feature-rich, visually-enhanced development environment.
- **Git Repository Integration**: Effortlessly connect to Git-based platforms like GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab to develop components by linking an existing repository.

### Seamless deployment
- **CI/CD**: Eliminate manual builds and unreliable deployments with Devant's industry-standard CI/CD tooling, providing complete control and flexibility.
- **Multi-Cloud Kubernetes**: Easily deliver cloud-native applications across Azure, AWS, GCP, or your Kubernetes clusters.
- **Configuration Management**: Centralize configuration parameters, sensitive credentials, and secrets across deployment environments via an intuitive interface.

### Effortless management of APIs, integrations, microservices, and web applications
- **Enable Security**: Empower security teams to manage data flows, ensuring seamless control over sensitive information like access credentials.
- **Scale Up or Down**: Kubernetes handles scaling automatically, optimizing costs by scaling services based on demand.
- **Ensure Reliability**: DevOps and SRE teams can easily manage deployed components with built-in insights and observability.

### Reusable digital assets
- **Control Visibility and Sharing**: Publish your digital assets to a shared marketplace for consumption by internal or external stakeholders, managed by role-based access control.
- **Internal Marketplace**: Devant's secure internal marketplace fosters transparency and efficiency with granular access control for publishers and consumers.

### Comprehensive observability
- **Anomaly Detection**: Stay ahead of issues with prompt notifications, ensuring balanced scaling and immediate action during unexpected mishaps.
- **Troubleshoot and Debug**: Quickly pinpoint and address root causes using detailed logs and data aligned in the same timeline, down to the machine-level details.

### Robust governance
- **DORA Metrics**: Monitor your DevOps efficiency with Devant DORA metrics, experiencing rapid improvements in time from deployment to production safely and robustly.
- **Engineering Insights**: Gain visibility into engineering insights and advanced data analytics to make data-driven decisions, optimize processes, and improve efficiency.
- **API Analytics**: Understand API performance and adoption patterns to identify and resolve operational bottlenecks.

Devant is your all-in-one platform for building, deploying, and managing cloud-native applications with ease, security, and efficiency.
