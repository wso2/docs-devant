# Use a Connection in Your Service

Devant allows you to share and reuse your services, accelerating development and enhancing efficiency in building integrated applications through connections.

For step-by-step on instruction on creating a connection, see [Create a Connection](create-a-connection.md).

To learn more about Devant Connections, see the documentation on [Connections](../../Devant-concepts/connections.md).

## Consume a service through a connection

You can consume a Devant-deployed service within another service. Consuming connections from within Devant services is seamless and straightforward. Follow the steps below to consume a Devant service:

### Step 1: Add connection configurations

To integrate another service into your application, click the appropriate tab below based on your current configuration file and follow the step-by-step instructions:

=== "Component.yaml file (v1.1)"

    1. Copy and paste the snippet from the in-line developer guide into the `component.yaml` file.

        The following is a sample snippet: 

        ``` yaml

        dependencies:
            connectionReferences:
            - name: <CONNECTION_NAME>
              resourceRef: <RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER>

        ```

          | Field            | Description                                                         |
          |------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
          | name             | The name given to the connection.                                   |
          | resourceRef      | A unique, readable identifier of the service being connected to.    |


    2. If you've previously added a `connectionReferences` section under `dependencies`, append this as another item under `connectionReferences`. Upon deploying the component, Devant automatically creates a subscription if applicable and the necessary configurations to establish the connection will be injected into the Devant-defined environment variables.
      
          The following table details the Devant-defined environment variables:

          | Configuration Key       | Devant-Defined Environment Variable Name                       |
          |-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
          | ServiceURL              | Devant_<CONNECTION_NAME\>_SERVICEURL                           |
          | ConsumerKey             | Devant_<CONNECTION_NAME\>_CONSUMERKEY                          |
          | ConsumerSecret          | Devant_<CONNECTION_NAME\>_CONSUMERSECRET                       |
          | TokenURL                | Devant_<CONNECTION_NAME\>_TOKENURL                             |
          | DevantAPIKey            | Devant_<CONNECTION_NAME\>DevantAPIKEY                          |


          If you want to use custom environment variable names instead of the Devant-defined ones, you must define the environment configurations under the `configuration` section in the same file.
          The following is a sample snippet: 

          ``` yaml
          configuration:
            env:
              - name: HR_SERVICE_URL
                valueFrom:
                  connectionRef:
                    name: hr-connection
                    key: ServiceURL
          ```

          The following table provides details on the configuration keys associated with the connection. These keys can be referenced as `env[i].valueFrom.connectionRef.key`.

          | Name           |  Type      |  Description                          |Optional       | Sensitive    |
          |----------------|------------|---------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|
          | ServiceURL     | string     | Service URL of the Devant service     | false         | false        |
          | ConsumerKey    | string     | Consumer key of the Devant service    | false         | false        |
          | ConsumerSecret | string     | Consumer secret of the Devant service | false         | true         |
          | TokenURL       | string     | Token URL of the STS                  | false         | false        |
          | DevantAPIKey   | string     | API key of the Devant service         | false         | true         |

          For more details, see the instructions under the **component.yaml file (v1.1)** tab.

    ### Step 2: Read configurations within the application

    Once you add the connection configuration snippet, you can proceed to read those configurations within your application. The steps to follow depend on the programming language you are using.

    The following is a sample code snippet in NodeJS:

    ``` java
    const serviceURL = process.env.Devant_<CONNECTION_NAME>_SERVICEURL;
    ```

=== "Component.yaml file (v1.0)"

    !!! note
        This `component.yaml v1.0` is a legacy configuration format. For new projects, we recommend using the latest version (v1.1) of `component.yaml` for improved usability and features.
  
    1. Copy and paste the snippet from the in-line developer guide into the `component.yaml` file.
      
        The following is a sample snippet:

        ``` yaml

        dependencies:
            serviceReferences:
            - name: <SERVICE_NAME>
              connectionConfig: <CONNECTION_ID>
              env:
              - from: ServiceURL
                to: <YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>
              - from: ConsumerKey
                to: <YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>
              - from: ConsumerSecret
                to: <YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>
              - from: TokenURL
                to: <YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>
              - from: DevantAPIKey
                to: <YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>

        ```

          | Field            | Description                                                 |
          |------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
          | name             | The name of the service you are connecting to.              |
          | connectionConfig | The unique connection identifier for the connection.        |
          | env              | The environment variable mapping.                           |
          | from             | The key of the configuration entry.                         |
          | to               | The environment variable name to which Devant will inject the value of the key.|


    2. Replace `<YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>` with an appropriate environment variable name of your choice. If you have previously added a service reference section under `dependencies`, append this as another item under `serviceReferences`. 

          Upon deploying the component, Devant automatically creates a subscription if applicable and populates the specified environment variables with actual values.


          The following table provides details on the configuration keys associated with the connection:

          | Name           |  Type      |  Description                          |Optional       | Sensitive    |
          |----------------|------------|---------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|
          | ServiceURL     | string     | Service URL of the Devant service     | false         | false        |
          | ConsumerKey    | string     | Consumer key of the Devant service    | false         | false        |
          | ConsumerSecret | string     | Consumer secret of the Devant service | false         | true         |
          | TokenURL       | string     | Token URL of the STS                  | false         | false        |
          | DevantAPIKey   | string     | API key of the Devant service         | false         | true         |

    <h3> Step 2: Read configurations within the application </h3>

    Once you add the connection configuration snippet, you can proceed to read those configurations within your application. The steps to follow depend on the programming language you are using.

    The following is a sample code snippet in NodeJS:

    ``` java
    const serviceURL = process.env.SVC_URL;
    ```

=== "Component-config.yaml file"

    !!! note
        This `component-config.yaml` is a legacy configuration format. For new projects, we recommend using the latest version (v1.1) of `component.yaml` for improved usability and features.

    1. Copy and paste the snippet from the in-line developer guide into the `component-config` file under the `spec` section.

        The following is a sample snippet:

        ``` yaml

        outbound:
            serviceReferences:
            - name: <SERVICE_NAME>
              connectionConfig: <CONNECTION_ID>
              env:
              - from: ServiceURL

              - from: ConsumerKey
                to: <YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>
              - from: ConsumerSecret
                to: <YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>
              - from: TokenURL
                to: <YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>
              - from: DevantAPIKey
                to: <YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>

        ```

          | Field            | Description                                                 |
          |------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
          | name             | The name of the service you are connecting to.              |
          | connectionConfig | The unique connection identifier for the connection.        |
          | env              | The environment variable mapping.                           |
          | from             | The key of the configuration entry.                         |
          | to               | The environment variable name to which Devant will inject the value of the key.|


    2. Replace `<YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>` with an appropriate environment variable name of your choice. If you have previously added an outbound service reference, append this as another item under `serviceReferences`. 

          Upon deploying the component, Devant automatically creates a subscription if applicable and populates the specified environment variables with actual values.


          The following table provides details on the configuration keys associated with the connection:

          | Name           |  Type      |  Description                          |Optional       | Sensitive    |
          |----------------|------------|---------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|
          | ServiceURL     | string     | Service URL of the Devant service     | false         | false        |
          | ConsumerKey    | string     | Consumer key of the Devant service    | false         | false        |
          | ConsumerSecret | string     | Consumer secret of the Devant service | false         | true         |
          | TokenURL       | string     | Token URL of the STS                  | false         | false        |
          | DevantAPIKey   | string     | API key of the Devant service         | false         | true         |

    <h3> Step 2: Read configurations within the application </h3>

    Once you add the connection configuration snippet, you can proceed to read those configurations within your application. The steps to follow depend on the programming language you are using.

    The following is a sample code snippet in NodeJS:

    ``` java
    const serviceURL = process.env.SVC_URL;
    ```

If you're using the API key security scheme for the connection, skip Step 3 and follow the instructions in [Step 4: API key security scheme](#step-4-invoke-the-service) tab.

### Step 3: Acquire an OAuth 2.0 access token

To consume a Devant service with the visibility level set to organization or public and secured by the OAuth 2.0 security scheme, you must obtain an OAuth 2.0 token from the token endpoint. Subsequently, you can use the token to invoke the service.

- For languages with OAuth 2.0-aware HTTP clients, you must pass the OAuth 2.0-related configurations such as client id, client secret and so on, obtained when creating the connection to your HTTP client configuration. The HTTP client autonomously manages token retrieval and refreshing.

- For languages without OAuth 2.0-aware HTTP clients, you must manually initiate a call to the token endpoint. This includes fetching the token and managing token expiration and refresh directly within your application code. The following is a sample curl command to obtain a token:


    ```bash
    CONSUMER_KEY="your_consumer_key"
    CONSUMER_SECRET="your_consumer_secret"
    TOKEN_URL="your_token_url"

    # Encode client credentials as Base64
    CLIENT_CREDENTIALS=$(echo -n "$CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET" | base64)

    curl -X POST $TOKEN_URL \
      -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
      -H "Authorization: Basic $CLIENT_CREDENTIALS" \
      --data-urlencode "grant_type=client_credentials"

    ```

### Step 4: Invoke the service

Click the tab that matches the security scheme of your service and follow the instructions below:

=== "API key security scheme"

     To invoke the API, use the `Devant-api-key` header with the API key value retrieved from the corresponding environment variable as described in [step 2](#step-2-read-configurations-within-the-application).

     The following is a sample code snippet in NodeJS:

     ``` java
       const response = await axios.get(serviceURL/{RESOURCE_PATH}, {
           headers: {
             'Devant-API-Key': `${DevantApiKey}`
           }
       });
     ```

=== "OAuth 2.0 security scheme"

     To invoke the service, use the following instructions based on your programming language:

      - For languages with OAuth 2.0-aware HTTP clients, use the service URL resolved in [Step 2](#step-2-read-configurations-within-the-application). The OAuth-aware client manages authentication automatically. For sample requests and responses, see the API definition provided via the Devant marketplace for the service.

      - For languages without OAuth 2.0-aware HTTP clients, use the token obtained in [step 3](#step-3-acquire-an-oauth-20-access-token) to make calls to the dependent service. Subsequently, add the obtained token to the HTTP authorization header with the bearer prefix. As the service URL, use the URL resolved in [step 2](#step-2-read-configurations-within-the-application). For sample requests and responses, see the API definition of the service provided via the Devant marketplace.

       The following is a sample code snippet in NodeJS:

       ``` java
       const response = await axios.get(serviceURL/{RESOURCE_PATH}, {
           headers: {
             'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
             'Devant-API-Key': `${DevantApiKey}`
           }
       });
       ```

    !!! note
        If you want to consume a Devant service at the project visibility level, you don't need to obtain a token. You can directly invoke the service using the resolved URL.
